Core Library Usage
------------------

To use this library first unzip to a directory on your computer.

Then in Visual Studio select Add a Reference and use the Browse tab to find the directory where you unzipped the archive.
In this directory you will find a directory named Core which contains several different builds of the library depending
on your target platform:

- .Net 3.5 and Mono -> Core/net35/dotNetRDF.dll
- .Net 3.5 Client Profile -> Core/net35-client/dotNetRDF.ClientProfile.dll
- Silverlight 4 -> Core/sl4/dotNetRDF.Silverlight.dll
- Silverlight 4 for Windows Phone 7 -> Core/sl4-wp/dotNetRDF.WindowsPhone.dll

dotNetRDF includes intellisense for all classes providing that the relevant XML documentation file from the appropriate build
is located in the same directory as the DLL file.

To use classes from the library it is generally easiest to import the namespaces you need eg.

C#
using VDS.RDF;

VB
Imports VDS.RDF

Please see the API at http://www.dotnetrdf.org/content.asp?pageID=API for further details on Namespaces,
Classes, Methods etc

Plugin Library Usage
--------------------

This package also contains several plugin libraries which provide additional optional features.

There are two data providers that can be used to access specific storage backends in conjunction
with the dotNetRDF API.  These are as follows:

- OpenLink Virtuoso -> Data/Virtuoso/dotNetRDF.Data.Virtuoso.dll
- Microsoft SQL Server and SQL Azure -> Data/Sql/dotNetRDF.Data.Sql.dll

There is a single query plugin that provides full text query support using Lucene.Net:

- Full Text Query -> Query/FullText/dotNetRDF.Query.FullText.dll

Note: Whichever of these plugin libraries you use you should also include the dependencies of that library to ensure it functions correctly.
Dependencies for each library can be found in the directory with the build.

Requirements
------------

To use this library you will need .Net Framework 3.5 SP1 and you may need to install/have available the 
following third party libraries:
- MySQL Connector.Net 6.0.3 which can be obtained from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/
- JSON.Net 4.0r2 which can be obtained from http://www.codeplex.com/Json
- HtmlAgilityPack 1.4.0 Stable which can be obtained from http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack

The relevant DLLs (HtmlAgilityPack.dll, MySql.Data.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.Net35.dll) are included with
this release and if you wish to use the library you may need to reference these DLLs as well to ensure it is available in your
project for dotNetRDF to use.

To use either the Data.Sql or Data.Virtuoso library you must inlude the Core library and its dependencies

If you wish to use the optional Data.Virtuoso library that is also included you will need the additional
OpenLink Virtuoso ADO.Net provider which can be found in the folder with the Data.Virtuoso library

Known Issues
------------

We are aware of the following issues with the library.  Please remember that this is an Beta release and so
there are things that may be buggy still and the API is subject to change at our discretion or based upon
user feedback.
 
Query and Update
- Queries and Updates are not always thread safe - see User Guide for details on how to guarantee this
- The SPARQL CSV/TSV results formats which we support do not currently match the official recommendations, this
  will be addressed in the next release

Storage
- Old SQL Stores are officially deprecated, a new SQL store is available as a separate library dotNetRDF.Data.Sql.dll
- Virtuoso support has been moved into a separate library to reduce dependencies in the core library, existing users
  who use dotNetRDF with Virtuoso must now use dotNetRDF.Data.Virtuoso.dll in addition to the core library
