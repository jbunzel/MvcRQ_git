dotNetRDF To Do
===============

This is a summary of the various TODOs currently in the source organised by project.

NOTE - This may not be up to date!

We use the following grades of To Dos:

REQ - This task is a requirement for the next release.  Often used when stub classes are added for
	  new features but not yet implemented or for important changes/improvements to existing features.
	  
HACK - The code near this TODO is a temporary work around typically for a bug/issue in 3rd party code/system
	   that our code interacts with and should be changed at some point subject to the resolution of the issue.
	   
BUG - This task denotes a bug that needs to be fix for which we don't yet have a fix/time to fix.
	  
TODO - This task should be done for the next release (time-permitting).  Typically used for nice
	   improvements that should be done at some point or used while working on new features to
	   indicate unfinished sections
	   
Q - This task may be necessary subject to the determination of the answer to the question in the To Do.

OPT - This task is optional (time-permitting) and is typically non-essential.

SLV - This task is related to porting to Silverlight

PORT - This task is related to porting 3rd party code onto the dotNetRDF API
